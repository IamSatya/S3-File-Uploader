FOLDER UPLOAD FIX - "No files provided" Error
===============================================

PROBLEM: Folder upload fails with "No files provided" error
CAUSE: Frontend was sending relativePaths incorrectly - needed to be an array

SOLUTION: One-line fix in Dashboard.tsx
-----------------------------------------

FILE TO UPDATE: client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
LINE: 175 (inside uploadFolderMutation)

CHANGE FROM:
  formData.append('relativePaths', (file as any).webkitRelativePath || file.name);

CHANGE TO:
  formData.append('relativePaths[]', (file as any).webkitRelativePath || file.name);

DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS (on VPS):
------------------------------

# 1. Navigate to your app
cd /var/www/hackfiles

# 2. Download Dashboard-FIXED.tsx from Replit attached_assets folder

# 3. Replace the file
cp Dashboard-FIXED.tsx client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx

# 4. Rebuild
npm run build

# 5. Restart PM2
pm2 restart hackfiles

# 6. Test folder upload
# - Select a folder with files
# - Should now upload successfully!

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✅ Select a folder with multiple files
✅ Upload button processes the folder
✅ All files appear in dashboard with correct folder structure
✅ No "No files provided" error

PM2 LOGS SHOULD SHOW:
---------------------
✅ POST /api/files/upload-folder 200 (success!)
❌ NOT: POST /api/files/upload-folder 400 "No files provided"
