🔧 FILE TRANSFER METHODS
========================

Since direct curl failed, here are alternative methods:

METHOD 1: Use SCP (Secure Copy) from Replit to VPS
---------------------------------------------------
From your LOCAL machine (not VPS):

# Download from Replit first
scp runner@workspace.satyapanuganti.repl.co:/home/runner/workspace/attached_assets/routes-FIXED.ts ./

# Then upload to VPS
scp routes-FIXED.ts root@drivetechnoidentityorg:/var/www/hackfiles/server/routes.ts


METHOD 2: Use Raw GitHub Gist
------------------------------
I'll create the files as text you can paste directly.


METHOD 3: Use Base64 Encoding
------------------------------
I can split files into base64 chunks you paste and decode on VPS.


RECOMMENDED: Let me split the files into CHUNKS for you to paste!
This is the most reliable method.

Which method do you prefer?
